# Tetris In C
Coding my version of the 1984 game of Tetris by Alexei Paschitnow in C.
I have no idea though how exactly the original game worked and what features it had or did not have. So it's only the look of it that resambels Paschitnow's game.
The game displayed on the console and is pretty flashy I kinda like that and I also don't know how to get rid of it.
I had planned to add the function to save scores locally and maybe display the top 10 somewhere but this is not currently in the game. Maybe I'll add it sometime.
